## Expense Tracker in Python
### Project Description

Ever wondered where all your money goes at the end of the month? This simple expense tracker helps you stay on top of your spending. This project is a Python-based Expense Management System that follows an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach. 
The system is designed to:
- Add new expenses (e.g., groceries, rent, fuel, etc.).
- View all expenses in a structured format.
- Search for expenses using a unique ID or title.
- Update an expense (e.g., if the amount changes).
- Delete expenses that are no longer needed.

## How to clone repository
The repository was cloned successfully following these steps. First, the repository link was copied from GitHub by selecting the "Code" button and choosing the HTTPS option. Next, Visual Studio Code was launched, and the terminal was opened by selecting View â†’ Terminal or using the shortcut Ctrl + ~. 
The terminal was then used to navigate to the desired folder where the repository would be stored using the cd command.
After reaching the correct directory, the repository was cloned by running the command:
- git clone <repository-link>
This command downloaded all the project files into the selected folder. Once the cloning process was completed, the terminal was used to navigate into the cloned repository folder using:
- cd your-repository
The project was then opened in VS Code with:
- code .
This opened all the project files in VS Code, allowing modifications and execution.
Finally, the script was run by ensuring Python was installed and executing the following command in the terminal:
- python filename.py

## How to run the code 
used main.py and testipynb
To run the project, the necessary files were set up, and the required dependencies were installed. The project directory was accessed, and the code was executed in two ways: 
Using the main.py file and the test.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
For running the code through main.py, a terminal was opened in Visual Studio Code. The script was executed using: Python Main.py

Alternatively, the code was tested interactively in test.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook. 
The test.ipynb file was opened and executed by running each file.
